# URL_Tree
##  Java Project

This is a simple Java Project that I made in my free time. 
Starting with a given link (wikipedia.com by default), it searches the site for links and follows those links (limited to a 
specific link level: 200 by default). At this point, I have been able to retrieve 60,000 links in about 2 minutes. The biggest
issue is network speed. From the image below, it is also visible that the program hits some kind of wall at about 600-800 links.
